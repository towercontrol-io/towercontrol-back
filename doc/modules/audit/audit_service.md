## Audit service - trace platform operation for later auditing activities


The audit service aggregates information that will later be used to perform an audit of the platform. These operations, 
such as user login, account creation, and password change requests, allow for tracking, detecting abnormal behaviors, 
and analyzing them.

The audit service makes it possible to persist audit information in a database, depending on the `audit.store.medium` 
parameter, which can be mongodb, postgresql, file, or logs. Audits are always formatted as JSON text lines for better 
readability and searchability. The format is as follows:


```json
{
    "service" : String,                     // Service name where the audit logs has been generated
    "action" : String,                      // Action, depends on the service
    "actionMs" : number,                    // Action start time ref, structure creation in ms
    "owner" : String,                       // Owner related, login hash
    "log": String,                          // Log information
    "params" : [ Strings ]                  // One encrypted parameter if != "" will take place in log between {}
}
```

Logs may contain sensitive information, and these will be displayed encrypted by default (Base64) so that they can be 
handled anonymously. It will also be possible to decrypt them if needed.

Log example :
```json
{ "service" : "users", "action" : "registration", "actionMs" : 1697030400000, "owner" : "xxxxxx", "log": "email {0} from ip {1}", "param" : ["eyJ1c2VyIjoiam9obmRvZSIsInBhc3N3b3JkIjoiMTIzNDU2In0=", "eyJ1c2VyIjoiam9obmRvZSIsInBhc3N3b3JkIjoiMTIzNDU2In0="] }
```

Encrypted print example:
```text
2023-10-11 12:00:00.000 [users] [registration] From xxxxx - email eyJ1c2VyIjoiam9obmRvZSIsInBhc3N3b3JkIjoiMTIzNDU2In0= from ip eyJ1c2VyIjoiam9obmRvZSIsInBhc3N3b3JkIjoiMTIzNDU2In0=
```

Decrypted print example:
```text
2023-10-11 12:00:00.000 [users] [registration] From xxxxx - email john.doe@foo.bar from ip 1.1.1.1
```

### Immutability (to be implemented) (@TODO)

In the database, audit logs are recorded with an immutability mechanism: each new audit entry includes
a hash that takes the previous audit entry into account. The goal is to create a chain of trust between 
audit entries. However, this approach does not guarantee that the entire set of entries has not been 
modified to hide one of them. For this reason, the solution includes a service that is recommended to 
be deployed on an external entity and that holds a key used to manage a secret which evolves every 10 
seconds and is used in the hashing chain. This secret is generated by AES-256 encrypting a secret key 
with a counter equal to the number of ten-second intervals since the Unix epoch in UTC. 

Without knowing the secret, it will not be possible to reconstruct the hashing chain afterwards.
